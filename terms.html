        <div class="card">
            <h2>Acceptance and Scope</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Slowbern Studios' ("Slowbern", "we", "us") website, video games, demos, betas, downloadable content, community spaces, and any other services we provide (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services on any platform (including Steam, the Apple App Store, Google Play, or console storefronts), you agree to these Terms and to any platform-specific rules. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Eligibility and Player Accounts</h2>
            <p>You must meet the minimum age rating and platform requirements for the game you are accessing. Some Services require an account with a third-party platform. You are responsible for keeping those credentials secure and for all activity under your account. Use of our multiplayer features, cloud saves, or cross-platform services may be subject to the policies of each storefront or hardware manufacturer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>License to Use the Services</h2>
            <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable license to download and use our games for your personal entertainment. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Slowbern and our licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or reverse engineer any part of the Services except where such restrictions are prohibited by law.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Game Access, Updates, and Early Builds</h2>
            <p>Game features, availability, and pricing may vary by platform or region. We may patch, update, or remove features (including online services) at any time to maintain security, comply with platform rules, or improve gameplay. Access to playtests, betas, or early access builds is provided "as is" and may be time-limited.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>User Conduct</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use the Services for any unlawful, harassing, infringing, or harmful purpose.</li>
                <li>Do not exploit bugs, use unauthorized third-party software, attempt to circumvent security or DRM, or interfere with other players' ability to enjoy the game.</li>
                <li>Respect community guidelines wherever we host discussions (forums, Discord, social channels). We may remove content or suspend access to protect the community.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>User Content and Feedback</h2>
            <p>Any content you submit (such as forum posts, bug reports, screenshots, or mods) remains yours, but you grant Slowbern a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, host, reproduce, modify, and display that content for the purpose of operating and improving the Services. Do not submit content you do not have the right to share. We may remove or refuse content that violates these Terms or platform policies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Purchases, Refunds, and Virtual Items</h2>
            <p>Purchases of games, downloadable content, or in-app items are handled by the storefront where you transact. Their payment terms, tax policies, and refund rules apply. We do not control or have access to your full payment information. Virtual items and in-game currency have no real-world monetary value, cannot be exchanged outside the game, and may be modified or discontinued at our discretion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Online Features and Connectivity</h2>
            <p>Some Services rely on internet connectivity, matchmaking, or third-party servers. We do not guarantee continuous availability of any online feature, leaderboard, or cloud save, and we may suspend or retire them when necessary for security, maintenance, legal, or business reasons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
            <p>The Services may include links to third-party sites or integrate features from platform providers, cloud services, or community tools. We do not control those services and are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk and subject to their terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. Your use of the Services is at your own risk. For additional details see our <a href="disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Slowbern and its affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising from or related to your use of the Services. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the specific Service giving rise to the claim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Slowbern, its affiliates, and their respective employees and partners harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your violation of these Terms, misuse of the Services, or infringement of any rights of a third party.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Suspension and Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to any Service at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you violated these Terms, a platform's policies, or engaged in fraudulent or harmful behavior. You may stop using the Services at any time; however, fees previously paid are non-refundable unless required by the applicable storefront or law.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms to reflect new products, legal requirements, or platform policies. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date and, when feasible, provide additional notice (for example, through patch notes or a banner on this site). Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the state in which Slowbern is based, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You agree that any dispute will be resolved in the courts located in that jurisdiction unless the applicable platform requires a different forum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@slowbernstudios.com">admin@slowbernstudios.com</a> or through the support tools provided by the storefront where you obtained the game.</p>
