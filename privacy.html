            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        </header>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Overview and Scope</h2>
            <p>Slowbern Studios ("Slowbern", "we", "us", or "our") builds and publishes video games, demos, and related services (the "Services"), including this website, downloadable builds distributed through storefronts like Steam, the Apple App Store, Google Play, and itch.io, as well as playtests, community channels, and mailing lists. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with any part of the Services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>The information we collect depends on how you engage with us. We limit collection to what we need to operate, secure, and improve our games.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact details and submissions:</strong> If you email <a href="mailto:admin@slowbernstudios.com">admin@slowbernstudios.com</a>, sign up for a newsletter, or send us playtest feedback, we receive the information you share (such as name, email address, platform handles, and message content).</li>
                <li><strong>Platform account data:</strong> Storefronts and platform holders (including Steam, the App Store, Google Play, Xbox, and PlayStation) may share non-sensitive identifiers with us, such as your user ID, display name, achievement status, or region, so we can verify entitlements, enable cross-play, or grant rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Gameplay, diagnostics, and device data:</strong> Our games may capture session metrics (progress, completion time, in-game actions), crash reports, anti-cheat signals, and basic device details (hardware model, OS version, language) to keep the experience stable and fair.</li>
                <li><strong>Transactions and entitlements:</strong> Purchases are processed by the storefront where you buy the game or in-app content. We may receive confirmation data (order IDs, product SKU, refund status) but not full payment card details.</li>
                <li><strong>Community and user-generated content:</strong> Posts, screenshots, or other submissions you share on our official forums, Discord server, or other channels we moderate may be stored to provide the feature and enforce community guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Website and cookie data:</strong> When you visit our website, hosting providers such as GitHub Pages log IP addresses, browser type, and requested files to operate the service. We currently do not run marketing analytics scripts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver, maintain, and update our games, demos, backend services, and community features.</li>
                <li>Provide customer support, bug triage, and communications about updates, playtests, or security notices.</li>
                <li>Measure performance, balance gameplay, and detect cheating or misuse.</li>
                <li>Verify eligibility for entitlements, rewards, and cross-platform features.</li>
                <li>Comply with legal requirements and platform policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
            <p>We do not set analytics or advertising cookies ourselves. Essential cookies or cached assets may be placed by our hosting provider or third-party CDNs to deliver the website securely. You can adjust your browser settings or see additional details in our <a href="cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Platforms and Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>When you access our games through a third-party platform (Steam, iOS, Android, console storefronts, etc.), that platform's privacy policy applies alongside ours. Those partners may collect data independently (such as platform telemetry, achievements, or purchase history) and share limited information with us so we can provide core functionality. We recommend reviewing the privacy statements for each platform you use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
            <p>We only share information as needed to provide the Services or when required by law.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Vendors that host our website, provide crash analytics, cloud saves, customer support, or email delivery process data on our behalf under contractual safeguards.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform and distribution partners:</strong> We share limited data to validate purchases, enable cross-play or achievements, and satisfy platform compliance obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and safety:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Slowbern, our players, or the public.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporate events:</strong> If we undergo a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may transfer subject to this Policy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We keep personal information only as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Crash logs and gameplay telemetry are periodically aggregated or deleted. You can request deletion of support tickets or community submissions by contacting us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We implement safeguards appropriate to the data we process, including access controls, encryption in transit where practical, and monitoring for suspicious activity. No system is perfectly secure, so please maintain strong passwords on the platforms you use to access our games.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>International Visitors</h2>
            <p>We operate primarily from the United States, and your information may be processed there or in other countries where our service providers operate. Those locations may have different data-protection laws, but we handle your information consistent with this Policy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Your Rights and Controls</h2>
            <p>Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict use of your personal information, or to opt out of certain processing. Contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@slowbernstudios.com">admin@slowbernstudios.com</a> with your request and include which game or platform it pertains to. You can also manage many privacy settings directly through the storefront you use (for example, Steam, Apple, or Google privacy dashboards).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Services are intended for players who meet the age rating requirements of the applicable platform or storefront. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided information without parental consent, please reach out so we can delete it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new games, features, or legal requirements. When we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date and, when feasible, provide additional notice (such as an in-game message or banner on this site).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>Questions or concerns about privacy? Email us at <a href="mailto:admin@slowbernstudios.com">admin@slowbernstudios.com</a> or use the support channel provided on the storefront where you play.</p>
